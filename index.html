              AverMax is a young and promising Progressive producer and DJ from Minsk.
            </p>

              <p>Like many people, I began to show interest in music when I was still a child, listening to the works of
              famous artists. Already at the age of 17, he signed his first 2 debut releases on the English label
              Crossair Recordings [Crossworld Rec.], which received support in various compilations.
            </p>
              <p>After some time,
              the list of releases includes a work called "Open Gate", remixes and the original version of which
              received positive reviews from famous producers, as well as regular support. The release was released on
              Proton Music's sub-label, Eternal Music.
              </p>
              <p>Throughout the entire time, AverMax has been working in parallel
              on its own radio show called "the Progressive Universe", which won the hearts of many colleagues and
              listeners with a great sense of music.
              </p>
              <p>I had the honor to perform on the same stage with Swanky Tunes,
              Fonarev, Bobina, DJ Feel, DJ Magnit.
              </p>
              <p>AverMax is also one of the founders of the well-known Belarusian club
              radio station Radio One, which has already ended its existence.
              </p>
              <p>Participant of the festivals: "Energy of
              summer 2012" and "Energy of summer 2013" in Minsk. Supports: MaRLo, DJ Feel.
